This project was initially developed as a sample during the "Game Development with Unity" training I conducted under the ACM Gazi Community. 
It was created to demonstrate and teach essential mechanics throughout the lessons. 
After the training, I continued to expand and improve the project personally, transforming it into a more functional and interactive example.
It also serves as my first complete public project that showcases my skills and experience in Unity on GitHub.
